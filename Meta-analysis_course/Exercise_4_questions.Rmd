## Questions.


Using the `dat.raudenbush1985` from week 3. Rerun the random-effects meta-analysis with REML estimation. 

* Make a funnel plot with study labels. What do you make of it?
* Make a funnel plot with inverse variance on the y-axis.
* Perform Egger's test for funnel plot asymmetry.
* Perform Begg & Mazumdar's test for funnel plot asymmetry. Based on _both_ Egger's test and this test what do you conclude.
* Make a contour-enhanced funnel plot. What does it reveal?
* Make a radial plot.
* **Bonus** perform and interpret a _p_ uniform analysis. For the purpose of this analysis treat the treatment effect `yi` in this dataset, as a Cohen's _d_.
