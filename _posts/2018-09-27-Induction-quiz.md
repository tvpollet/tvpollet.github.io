It is the start of the year, again. I was recently 'promoted' to Director of Learning and Teaching: 'experience' (though it could be 'journey', I always forget which title... .). And one of the perks is that I get to hold the Induction Quiz. If you want to play along you can do so [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/Quiz/Quiz.html#1){:target="_blank"}. I'll post a link with the solution later. Also, if you are student, know that if there is anything relating to your experience, and how we can improve it, please tell [me](mailto:thomas.pollet@northumbria.ac.uk) or your student rep.

**Update** : [Here](https://tvpollet.github.io/Quiz-Solution/Quiz-solution.html#1){:target="_blank"} you can find the solution! Enjoy.
