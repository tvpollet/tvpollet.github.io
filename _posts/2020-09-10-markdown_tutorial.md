For my course ([PY0794](https://tvpollet.github.io/PY0794/)), I made a [very short introduction to Markdown on youtube](https://youtu.be/xuk8yGJJO40). Have a look. There was a hiccup, as I couldn't seem to get it to accept my solution to paragraphs in lists? (Lesson 6, final element). Anyway, I have never had to use it, so don't worry, if it also fails for you. By the way this post is written in Markdown as well (and actually wherever possible, I now write in (R)markdown. More about that later! For now, enjoy me working through a tutorial, and then getting stuck... .
