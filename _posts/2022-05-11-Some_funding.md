A quick post. While I have known for a bit, I thought I would share that we have been awarded a [BA - Leverhulme small research grant](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/funding/ba-leverhulme-small-research-grants/). Together with [Jeanne Bovet](https://www.jeannebovet.com/), we will be looking at some evolutionary psychology textbooks. In particular, we want to find out which animal species and cultures are covered. We hope to then also explore whether the animal or cultural examples used in these textbooks are representative. More updates to follow but for now: just to say that I am very grateful to be able to undertake this research.
