Just a quick post, to tell you that we have a new [preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/xt8ey/){:target="_blank"}. This was a project led by my Bachelor project student who did his project on nerds (N=472). It is a short report on the Nerdy Personality Attribute Scale. We uncover a three factor structure and examine how it relates to self-identified neediness. It is very exploratory and preliminary but we hope it could be an interesting start.
