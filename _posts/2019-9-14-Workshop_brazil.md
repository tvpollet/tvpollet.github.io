Just a quick post, to tell you that I am giving a [workshop](https://tvpollet.github.io/Meta-analysis_course){:target="_blank"} in Natal (Brazil). It was a learning curve and I learned a lot about meta-analyses, including how to improve my own (captain hindsight,...)! There are 6 sessions where I'll cover all the bits and bobs, and currently 3 exercises (hopefully 5 by the time I have landed). The workshop is generously sponsored by [HBES](www.hbes.com). As mentioned, on the link for the course materials, let me know your suggestions.
