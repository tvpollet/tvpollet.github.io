Tomorrow, I'll give a talk on robust ranking methods as applied to rankings in student guides. A lot to be unpacked but in a nut shell when we applied some ranking methods from other fields we might get different conclusions.

You can find the slides [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/University_rankings/University_rankings/Robust_ranking.html#1). You can navigate via arrows. The slides were made with [Xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan). I look forward to developing this small project together with [Lee Shepherd](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/s/lee-shepherd/) and [Merim BilaliÄ‡](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/b/merim-bilalic)
