It has been a long year and I have not posted too much but as the year draws to a close: A very quick post. This is to announce that we have updated our [preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/xt8ey/){:target="_blank"}. This was a project led by my Bachelor project student who did his project on nerds/geeks. It is a short report on the Nerdy Personality Attribute Scale. We uncover a three factor structure and examine how it relates to self-identified neediness. It is very exploratory and preliminary but we hope it could be an interesting start for more research in this area. Our data and materials are available on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/5njdx/){:target="_blank"}. It has been a very long journey, first version dates back to April 2019, but here is to hoping that it will be published in 2021! Have a great break everybody.
