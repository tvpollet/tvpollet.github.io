We have a new preprint. This paper is a research article demonstrating how institution ranking lists compare to a robust ranking method based on subjects, in a UK context. Simply put, publications such as the Guardian produce lists of institutions overall, next to rankings of institutions by each subject. However, these subject lists vary in length making comparisons difficult. Using a robust ranking method, we investigated the correspondence between rankings across subjects, with institution lists produced by the Guardian University Guide and the Complete University Guide. Our key finding is that we found discrepancies -with substantial shifts in rankings if one relied on a robust ranking method across these two commonly used lists (> 10 ranks; with lists of approximately 120-130). Therefore, the indiscriminate use of institution ranking lists may be problematic. You can check it out [here](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/fdkj5). Thanks to my co-authors.
