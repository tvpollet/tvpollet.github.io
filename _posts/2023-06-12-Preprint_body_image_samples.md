Just a very brief post to underline, that we have a new preprint! This one has been simmering for quite a bit, I presented some of the [data earlier](https://tvpollet.github.io/Talk_appearance_Durham_22/Talk_Durham_Body_Image_22.html#1). And finally we have. a [preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/2qfdb/). Very simply put, we examined a volume, i.e. one year, of _Body Image_. We found that there was a considerable chunk of student samples. In contrast clinical samples were relatively rare. If BMI was measured, it was typically self-reported rather than measured. We used some 'fancy' simuations and found that samples which we labelled as from the 'general population', differ from reference values of the population at large for age and BMI. Student samples scored significantly lower on BMI than population estimates for the same age group. We discuss what this might mean for the field of _Body Image_ research and make some recommendations.

Enjoy and have a read! And many thanks to my co-authors. Fingers crossed that some journals like it.
