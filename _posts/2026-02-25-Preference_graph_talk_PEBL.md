Today I'm presenting what is very much a work in progress for our lab group. It's a short talk about using graphs to help us select stimuli in a context where we collect ratings. Often a evolutionary psychology designs will use an "attractive" face or an "unattractive" face attached to a vignette. And these stimuli are selected based on some criterion, such as a top % rule or a mean+/-sd rule. 

In the talk, I present an alternative, which is to build graphs for each participant and then summarize these. Curious? Have a look at the [slides](https://tvpollet.github.io/PEBL_preference_graph/Preference_graph.html). The talk is light on content but heavy on memes. Use arrows to navigate. If you want to save a copy just use ctrl+p in your browser (cmd + p on Mac) and use save as .pdf. (Unfortunately no animations in that case).
