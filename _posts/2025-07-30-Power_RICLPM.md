I recently had to review a paper which led me down a rabbit hole. I'll save you the details, but it prompted me to do a power analysis for a Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel model (RI-CLPM). I thought I might as well share my attempt, in case somebody else out there has to do this. Hopefully, this is of use to somebody. I recommend that you also read [Mulder, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1080/10705511.2022.2122467) and note 'caveat emptor' - you might want to scrutinise further and also kick the tires with regard to assumptions such as multivariate normality, etc.

You can find my attempt [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/docs/RICLPM/power_RICLPM_review.html) and this [.rmd](https://tvpollet.github.io/docs/RICLPM/power_RICLPM_review.Rmd). As a bonus, you'll find out what I made of the authorsâ€™ suggested sample size, but I guess you can tell from the picture of the post... .

Enjoy!
