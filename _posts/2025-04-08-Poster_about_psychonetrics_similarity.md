Time flies. Following a talk about similarity to humans. I am presenting a poster with Jeanne Bovet at [www.ehbea2025.com](www.ehbea2025.com) - but any mistakes are my own. You can view the poster [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/Poster_primate_similarity_portrait.html) - note it is actual size you'll need to zoom out. 

A reminder that the slides are available [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/pebl_monkey_me_talk/Talk_monkey_me.html#1). They are made with Xaringan in R. It is very much work in progress. Thanks to my co-author(s) and the [British Academy](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/) for the funding.
