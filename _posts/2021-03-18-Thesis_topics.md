I am happy to announce that I have made a list of thesis projects for the next academic year. These topics are suitable for Bachelor, MSc. and MRes. level. As always, I strongly encourage replication projects. Nothing beats a well-done replication study for your project. I also encourage projects on social network analysis and 'meta-science'. Anyway, you can see them all [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/thesis_topics/){:target="_blank"}. Hopefully, we are good fit!
