Right before the end of the year, another brief post. The year has just flown by! Just to let you know that we have submitted a [new preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/ubt2a/) to PsyArxiv. This is a project led by [Jeanne Bovet](https://www.jeannebovet.com/) and also involved [Arnaud Tognetti](https://arnaudtognetti.mystrikingly.com/). It is the first real collaboration with Jeanne as lead - yay! Jeanne would probably do a much better job at explaining the paper than I do. In a nutshell, we review a series of problems when people use face databases like ['the facesaurus'](https://nickholtzman.com/faceaurus/). This databases are great resources, but we often do not realise potential issues (e.g., the limited sample from which they were generated). In the paper, we review the use of one example database, and some potential issues, such as pseudoreplication. Have a read! (Or don't and just have a festive break).
