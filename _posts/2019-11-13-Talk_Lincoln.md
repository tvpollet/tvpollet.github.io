A quick post in the middle of the semester, to tell you that I am giving a [talk](https://tvpollet.github.io/Lecture-LSHTM-19/LSHTM.html#1){:target="_blank"} at the university of Lincoln. You'll notice that this is actually largely the same talk I gave at LSHTM in London (and at UFRN), which is also why I kept this link. In this talk, I review my work on egocentric social networks. All the relevant papers including preprints can be found under 'papers' on this website. I am very grateful to Martin Tov√©e and Kamila Irvine for being excellent hosts!
