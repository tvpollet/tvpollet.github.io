This is just a small post, to celebrate that [our preprint](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ydb5v_v2) on gender and indexes in evolutionary psychology text books is now accepted for publication in _Human Ethology_ . Thanks to my co-authors, helpful reviewers and the editor ([Iris Holzleitner](https://people.uwe.ac.uk/Person/IrisHolzleitner)) for their support.

Enjoy!
