I built two apps with [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) which allows building apps in R. I then deployed these via [Shinylive](https://github.com/posit-dev/r-shinylive) to GitHub pages. So they run in your browser. Though, it could take some time to load

* **App 1**: This is an open science escape room which I will unleash on my students. [https://tvpollet.github.io/shiny_live_open_science_escape_room/](https://tvpollet.github.io/shiny_live_open_science_escape_room/) . Can you escape in under 15 mins?

* **App 2**: A simple timer. Often in class, students need to do a task individually or in group. I have built a very simple count down timer. Have a look here.
[https://tvpollet.github.io/shiny_live_timer/](https://tvpollet.github.io/shiny_live_timer/). The colours could be prettier and the sounds are basic, but it does the job.

I used [Claude.ai](www.claude.ai) to help build these. It did OK but occasionally needed to be beaten with a stick to do what I wanted it to do... . Nonetheless, no way I could have built this from scratch in a short timeframe.

Have a great weekend, everybody!
