As I needed to sort out the review for a bunch of abstracts, I decided to venture into the Shiny world. This worked surprisingly well - with some AI prompting, I managed to get something half decent up and running. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/tvpollet/shiny_review_app).

This is what it looks like:

I'll give it a whirl and see if it does the job.
