A very brief post to highlight a session which I gave last week to our prospective students, slides can be found [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/open_day_lecture_jealousy/Jealousy_lecture.html){:target="_blank"}. I have picked the same topic as for the Master students as t also allows me to do some shameless self-promotion of our [forthcoming paper](https://psyarxiv.com/28yvp/) in _Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin_. I also get to waffle on about meta-analyses, which I always enjoy,... . Anyway, hopefully of interest,... .
