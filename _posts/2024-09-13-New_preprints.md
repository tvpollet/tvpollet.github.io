A very brief post to tell you about some new preprints. Hurrah!

First up, already a bit out of date now, as I uploaded this two months ago. There is a preprint on potential gender bias in evolutionary psychology books. In a nutshell, we found that around 1 in 4 women indexed in seven evolutionary books. And we tell you which women are indexed more than once You can read about it [here](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/ydb5v). And an earlier poster based on preliminary findings can be found [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/Poster_gender_portrait.html).

The second preprint, is led by [Victor Shiramizu](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/medeiros_shiramizuvictor_kenjidr/) who generously invited me onto this project. This paper deals with the 'congruency hypothesis', a finding that women report lower sexual satisfaction when they change their use of oral contraception after meeting their partner, as opposed to those who do not. On a whole, there appears to be weak evidence at best for this hypothesis. Read all about it [here](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/x2u6s).
