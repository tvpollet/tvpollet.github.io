Tomorrow, I am giving a talk for the [PACT Lab](http://www.pactlab.org.uk/). It is a little bit scattered, as usual. It just pulls together the random bits and pieces, I have been doing relating to cyberpsychology. These cover topics as diverse as online dating, CVs, and Facebook usage and egocentric social networks. What perhaps binds it together is trying out novel methodologies and software packages (e.g., [gephi](http://www.gephi.org)). As always, I am greatly indebted to all my colleagues past and present. I hope this will spark some interest and open up some new avenues for collaborations. You can find the lecture [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/Lecture-PACT/Lecture_PACT.html). In Google Chrome, Safari or Opera,  you can get a.pdf via print (Cmd + P or ctrl + P). Enjoy!
