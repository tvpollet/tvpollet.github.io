I am lucky enough to find myself in sunny Spain on a workshop on evolutionary social psychology organised by [Bram Buunk](www.apbuunk.com). Perhaps, I am always going to be an outsider but, I think, I have seen the good, the bad and ugly. [Here](https://tvpollet.github.io/Javea2018/Lecture_Javea_2018.html), you can find my slides and see what I mean. Anyway, a bit of a haphazard talk but hopefully some overview of what I have been doing.
