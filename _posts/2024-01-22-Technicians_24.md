Today, I am presenting about [UKRN](http://www.ukrn.org) for a technicians event at Northumbria University. It is a bit bittersweet as this is my last act as UKRN Institution lead. 

You can find the slides [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/Technician_event_24/UKRN.html#1). You can navigate via arrows. The slides were made with [Xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan). I thank [Cecil Cherian Lukose](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/c/cecil-cherian-lukose/).
