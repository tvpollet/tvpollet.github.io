A very brief post to highlight a session which I gave last week to our 3rd year bachelor project students, slides can be found here [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/developing_a_scientific_rationale/Developing_a_scientific_rationale.html#1){:target="_blank"}. Probably, I am not the best person to deliver such a session, as I wouldn't qualify myself as being very theoretically rigorous. Then again, sometimes I think an excellent project can consist of trying to replicate an original study. This brings me to the next point: Open Science.

Tomorrow I'll be teaching our Res. Students a bit about the practical aspects of Open Science. Fingers crossed that it goes well. The slides can be found [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/open_science_talk/OSF-talk.html#1). I am grateful again for the [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package which allows me to make beautiful slides, fairly effortlessly.
