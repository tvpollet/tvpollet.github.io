A very brief post that our paper on sampling in _Body Image_ is now published. A lot to be unpacked but in a nut shell: these samples tend to differ from the general population - they tend to be younger and thinner. In addition, we find that there are likely some blind spots, for example, some countries are not represented.  We argue that it would be great if researcher add more information on if and how their findings might generalise. You can read about it [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bodyim.2024.101714).
