Today I'll give a five minutes lightning talk on sampling in _Body Image_. A lot to be unpacked but in a nut shell: these samples tend to differ from the general population.

You can find the slides [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/BA_conference_sampling/Talk_BA_conference_sampling.html#1). You can navigate via arrows. The slides were made with [Xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan).
