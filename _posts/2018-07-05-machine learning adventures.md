I am lucky enough to find myself in Amsterdam at [HBES](www.hbes.com), just after being in sunny Spain. [Here](https://tvpollet.github.io/HBES2018/Lecture_HBES.html), you can find my slides and see what I attempted in terms of trying to use machine learning to predict settlement patterns the ethnographic atlas. This would not have been possible without [NIAS](www.nias.nl) and [Mathijs van Dijk](https://www.rsm.nl/people/mathijs-van-dijk/).
