A very brief post to highlight a session which I gave last week to our MSc. Psychology students (Conversion degree), slides can be found [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/jealousy_lecture/Jealousy_lecture.html#1){:target="_blank"}. I was asked by a colleague to pick a classic study within my area of interest. Classic here does not mean personal favourite, but I think [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247781242_Sex_Differences_in_Jealousy_Evolution_Physiology_and_Psychology){:target="_blank"} by Buss and colleagues (1992) serves as a very useful teaching example. It also allows me to do some shameless self-promotion of our [forthcoming paper](https://psyarxiv.com/28yvp/) in _Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin_. I also get to waffle on about meta-analyses, which I always enjoy,... . Anyway, hopefully of interest,... .
