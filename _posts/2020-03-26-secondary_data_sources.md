A small post about a new resource on my website. As COVID-19 is causing a lot of disruption, a minor part is to student projects. Students who were planning on collecting data in person can no longer do so. Now obviously a lot of research can move to online data collection. Another opportunity lies in analysing already existing data. And there is a tonne of data out there. So, on [this page](https://tvpollet.github.io/secondary_data_sources) I have compiled some resources for secondary data analysis.
