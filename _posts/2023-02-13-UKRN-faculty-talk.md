Today, I presented some promotion on [UKRN](https://tvpollet.github.io/faculty_ukrn_talk/Lecture_open_science_faculty.html#1) at our faculty research meeting. You can click on the link to view the presentation (navigate with arrows). I have been in post now for a while as institution lead and I hope to generate an interest in Open Research practices beyond psychology, as, to date, the focus has lied heavily on this discipline. I also hope that our March 29th event will generate further interest across our institution. For now: enjoy the slides!
