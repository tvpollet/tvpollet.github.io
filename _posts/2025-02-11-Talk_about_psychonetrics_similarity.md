It already seems eons ago but at one point we received some funding to look into Evolutionary Psychology text books. What struck me is that often exemplars get invoked, non-human animals, to illustrate a point about for example, altruism. We wondered if that might influence about how individuals could think about humans. As a very first step we ran two studies on rating similarity of various species to humans. I won't say much more, you can just go over the slides for my talk tomorrow for a local research group (PEBL). The slides are available [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/pebl_monkey_me_talk/Talk_monkey_me.html#1). They are made with Xaringan in R. It is very much work in progress. Thanks to my co-author(s) and the [British Academy](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/) for the funding. PS. I know that monkey and me is not apt as it largely deals with apes as well :).
