Tomorrow I'll present a guest lecture on Open Research to our third year bachelor students. I'll cover why we think open research important and some other bits and bobs. You can find slides here: [https://tvpollet.github.io/Guest_lecture_open_research_BSc_thesis/Open_research.html#1](https://tvpollet.github.io/Guest_lecture_open_research_BSc_thesis/Open_research.html#1). You can use the arrows to navigate. If you want to print a copy, use CMD + P or CTRL + P and save as .pdf. 

In addition I made an open science escape room. If you haven't already tried it, please have a go: [https://tvpollet.github.io/shiny_live_open_science_escape_room/](https://tvpollet.github.io/shiny_live_open_science_escape_room/) Fingers crossed that it goes well!
