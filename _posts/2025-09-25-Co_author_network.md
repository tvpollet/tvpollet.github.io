Following a [post](https://bsky.app/profile/matti.vuorre.com/post/3lzm3wl35zc2n) by [Matti Vuorre](www.vuorre.com) on how to plot a [PsyArxiv](www.psyarxiv.com) co-author network over on BlueSky, I had a stab at making my own! My attempt is below. Code can be found [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/Files_for_sharing/Psy_Arxiv_website.html).

Some nice clusters! I am really chuffed, keen-eyed readers will spot some Northumbria collaborators. I also want to highlight that a lot of collaborators who were students at the time show up. 

Thanks to Matti for making a tutorial.
