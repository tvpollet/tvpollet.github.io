A very brief post to indicate that, if and when possible, I'll generate some screencasts for my classes of my [advanced quantitative methods](/PY0794) course. You can find the first set [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFHSdfkSiJ0&list=PLeRo-gE9BBdxeXRFATayNjgasAUkeLbwl){:target="_blank"}. I apologise for my terrible voice (and accent). Hopefully, it is of use to some. 

I also found some time and I finally managed to generate an exercise associated with the fifth lecture on [meta-analysis](/Meta-analysis_course). You can check it out [here](/Meta-analysis_5/Exercise_5_questions.html) and the result can be found [here](/Meta-analysis_5/Exercise_5.html)
