Tomorrow, I'll be presenting some [work in progress](https://tvpollet.github.io/Talk_appearance_Durham_22/Talk_Durham_Body_Image_22.html) at the Body Psychology research meeting at Durham University. You can click on the link to view the presentation (navigate with arrows). I won't give too much away, but basically we coded some samples in the journal _'Body Image'_ and examined how they might be similar or different to the general population.
