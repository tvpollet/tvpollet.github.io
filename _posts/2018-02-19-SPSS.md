It is that time of year again, not  a festive period, but rather that time when students start drafting their theses (or internship reports). Often I see copy and pasted tables and figures straight out of SPSS. Inevitably, these make me cry and want to scratch my eyes out. That shouldn't happen, ahem.  So I made some screen casts on how to avoid that. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtkG4fXEyLg&t=5s) I explain how to make a prettier table and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0jYSJI93vk&t=3s) I explain how to make a nicer figure for your thesis. Enjoy!
