In my home country (Belgium), schools are back on. Soon the academic year starts off here at Northumbria University. To that end, I have compiled an ['induction'](https://tvpollet.github.io/induction_PY0794) page for my quantitative research methods course ([PY0794](https://tvpollet.github.io/PY0794/)). I'll update it in due course but already some things to browse through if you are a student and even some quizzes to check your knowledge!
