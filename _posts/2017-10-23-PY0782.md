Today, I spoke to some prospective thesis students in occupational psychology at Northumbria University. While, I am no occupational psychologist some of my research is potentially relevant to organisational psychology students (e.g., work on minimal cues in CV's). I do not have much to offer as far as collaborations with the private sector go but perhaps there are some interesting questions, you would want to investigate! You can find the presentation I gave [here](https://prezi.com/-byyjveie3ni/ideas-for-master-thesis/). Anyway, any prospective thesis students have a look at my website and feel free to suggest your own topic.
