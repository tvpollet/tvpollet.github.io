Just a quick post, to tell you that I am presenting a poster at EHBEA in lovely Toulouse. I'll be standing next to it, awkwardly nodding. This is still very much work in progress, but we analyse the probabilities of red vs. blue winning at the Olympics (and boxing championships). A copy of our poster can be found [here](/pdfs/Poster_olympics_EHBEA_2019.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Also check out the poster by Tamsin Saxton which covers [our preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/s7ta8/){:target="_blank"} on hunger and preferences for larger bodies (and objects)!
