Today, I am presenting about [UKRN](http://www.ukrn.org) and open research for the interdisciplinary research theme on [gendered violence and abuse](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/research/idrts/gendered-violence-and-abuse/)  

You can find the slides [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/Open_research_gender_violence_IDRT_25/Open_Research.html#1). You can navigate via arrows. To get a copy to download use ctrl+p or cmd+p (mac) and then save as .pdf. The slides were made with [Xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan).
