It is finally done: [www.ehbea2025.com](www.ehbea2025.com) finished a while back. And I have just about recovered. It didn't help that I felt ill for most of it. I think it went well largely due to the excellent team - I am but a small cog in the machine.

It was a huge time sink but some rewarding things, I guess. There are also some side effects. I did learn some things. For example, via 'vibe coding' I managed to set up a schedule page [https://tvpollet.github.io/ehbea_2025_schedule/EHBEA_2025_Schedule_html](https://tvpollet.github.io/ehbea_2025_schedule/EHBEA_2025_Schedule_html). I also learned how to turn this into an OK .pdf - see [https://tvpollet.github.io/ehbea_2025_schedule/EHBEA_2025_Schedule_pdf.pdf](https://tvpollet.github.io/ehbea_2025_schedule/EHBEA_2025_Schedule_pdf.pdf). Hopefully skills that will prove useful elsewhere.

I also had to set up a system to implement a voting system in R, so we could quickly tally votes. And I previously posted about a shiny app for evaluating abstracts: [https://tvpollet.github.io/2024-12-16-App_built/](https://tvpollet.github.io/2024-12-16-App_built/).

Some of it is not perfect (I also messed up some things in prior iterations with regard to abstract decisions), and with hindsight for example, I would have setup a different system to process the schedule rather than combining data from multiple spreadsheets (which is what it ended up being ;/)

Anyway, this is just to remind me of secondary benefits of doing this sort of thing... . But now back to work.
