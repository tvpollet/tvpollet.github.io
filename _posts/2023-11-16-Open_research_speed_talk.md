Yesterday, I gave a short talk about two open research projects which we recently conducted. You can find the slides [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/open_res_11_23/talk_open_res_11_23.html#1). I rushed through it but it is 90% gifs. You can navigate via arrows. The slides were made with [Xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan). The biblionetrics project lives [here](https://connmal.github.io/Bibliometrix_Northumbria/About.html). At present, there is no repository for the open research and ref scores project but if you want to find out more drop me a line.
