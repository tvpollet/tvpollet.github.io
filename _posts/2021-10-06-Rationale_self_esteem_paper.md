A very brief post to highlight a session which I will host tomorrow for our 3rd year bachelor project students, slides can be found here [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/developing_a_scientific_rationale/Developing_a_scientific_rationale.html#1){:target="_blank"}. Probably, I am not the best person to deliver such a session, as I wouldn't qualify myself as being very theoretically rigorous. Then again, sometimes I think an excellent project can consist of trying to replicate an original study. Hopefully that comes across from these slides.

We also published our [preprint on sexual self esteem](https://tvpollet.github.io/pdfs/Lloyd_et_al_2021.pdf){:target="_blank"}. So do have a look. In a nutshell, we meta-analysed a commonly used scale's Cronbach's alpha and found it to be fairly robust. That's not to say that there are no other aspects of measurement which will require a closer look! Many thanks to my co-authors: Alaric Lloyd and Genavee Brown. Now perhaps we need to follow up further on those other aspects of measurement... . Stay Tuned... .
