Busy times. So, it has been a while but there are a couple of [new preprints](https://tvpollet.github.io/papers#preprints) which we have put out. This is next to updating preprints.

What do we have:

* [A paper on measurement equivalence of the UCLA 3 loneliness scale](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fpmur){:target="_blank"} - this uses two samples and leads us to conclude that there is a three factor solution, as suggested by some other researcher. Men and women
* [A paper on scale structure in the National Student Survey](https://psyarxiv.com/vb2k6/){:target="_blank"} - together with Lee Shepherd. We wrote a small paper examining the structure of subscales in the NSS. The NSS proposes that the items can be grouped into eight clusters. As you will be able to read for yourself, it appears that there is quite a lot of variability in how these items cluster. This likely has some implications on how we use such measures.
* [A paper led by Alexandra Thompson using psychometric network analyses](https://psyarxiv.com/fauc4/){:target="_blank"}. Alexandra examined the structure of commonly used loneliness scales in a sample of older adults. There are many findings to unpack but perhaps an important one is that, with the exception of one scale, the [SELSA](https://interpersona.psychopen.eu/index.php/interpersona/article/view/3577){:target="_blank"}, these measures largely tap into social loneliness. 


We also published our [preprint on fat talk](https://tvpollet.github.io/pdfs/Pollet_et_al_2021_Body_Image.pdf){:target="_blank"} and have been updating a bunch of other preprints. Long story short, I need a break but luckily summer is around the corner.

Here is to hoping that the other preprints are published,... .
