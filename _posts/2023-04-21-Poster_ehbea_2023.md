At [EHBEA 2023](https://ehbea2023.wixsite.com/ehbea-2023/), I presented a poster on a side project: Gender and indices in Evolutionary Psychology textbooks. It is still work in progress, but for now, a one sentence summary: **Women make up around 1 in 4 entries in indices from five major evolutionary psychology textbooks**. [Here](https://tvpollet.github.io/Poster_gender_portrait.html) you can find the poster. You will need to use zoom in your browser. It was made in R with the amazing [posterdown package](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown/wiki/posterdown_betterport#introduction). Enjoy! And many thanks to my co-authors.
