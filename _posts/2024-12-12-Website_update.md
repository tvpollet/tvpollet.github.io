A very brief post to tell you about the website update. Hurrah!

This was all driven by the fact that I wanted a bluesky button at the bottom of my page. Sigh. Anyway, can you spot the other differences?

It might not look like much but after 2 years or so - I synced up to the latest [Dean Attali Beautiful Jekyll template](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll?tab=readme-ov-file). Many thanks to Dean!
