Today, I presented very briefly on at the [UKRN](https://www.ukrn.org/) Institution lead meeting. Basically, I covered two projects funded by our research culture budget at Northumbria. One is about coding open research practices and reviewer scores and one is about bibliometrics. Find the slides [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/ukrn_institution_lead2023/UKRN_talk.html#1).
