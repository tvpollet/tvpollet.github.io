Today, I'll give a brief talk on a small funded project which we are about to launch. It deals with bees - well more accurately pollinators. Local parks have set up some interventions which might help pollinators and this pilot project we will examine how these might be received by residents close to the parks or visitors.

You can find the slides [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/Bee_Awesome_IDRT/Bee_awesome.html#1). You can navigate via arrows. The slides were made with [Xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan). I look forward to starting this small project together with [Lee Shepherd](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/s/lee-shepherd/) (Psychology), [Katherine Baldock](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/b/katherine-baldock/) (Geography and Environmental Sciences), [Mark Goddard](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/g/mark-goddard/) (Geography and Environmental Sciences) and [Barbara Hooper](https://urbangreennewcastle.org/about-us/meet-the-team/) ([Urban Green](https://urbangreennewcastle.org/)). This is a small update, so I apologise if you have already seen it!
