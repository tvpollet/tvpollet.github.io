Just a quick post, to tell you that I am giving a [talk](https://tvpollet.github.io/Lecture-LSHTM-19/LSHTM.html#1){:target="_blank"} at LSHTM. This was perhaps a bit of a rush job (still feeling the post-conference blues from EHBEA @ Toulouse). In this talk, I review my work on egocentric social networks. All the relevant papers including preprints can be found under 'papers' on this website.
