Just a very quick post, to tell you that I am giving a [talk](https://tvpollet.github.io/Lecture-LSHTM-19/LSHTM.html#1){:target="_blank"} at UFRN. You'll notice that this is actually largely the same talk I gave at LSHTM in London, which is also why I kept this link. In this talk, I review my work on egocentric social networks. All the relevant papers including preprints can be found under 'papers' on this website. This was generously sponsored by [HBES](www.hbes.com) and [LECH @ UFRN](https://www.lechufrn.com/) and I am very grateful to my amazing Brazilian hosts for putting it together!
