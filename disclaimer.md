All judicial issues are subject to Dutch law, no other (national, international) court will deal with legal issues arising from this website or presentations (prezis(c)). (So any judicial claim, should be submitted to a Dutch court).

### On a lighter note... .

By visiting this site you concur that:    
- Belgian beer and chocolate are the best in the world
- That Cobra is superior to G.I. Joe
- Sega is better than Nintendo
- That Antwerp is the by far nicer than Liverpool, Newcastle, Bruges, Louvain, Brussels (oh yes, Jolein), Ghent and obviously the entire of Germany.
-  Mia by Gorki is the best song in Dutch ever. (Yet, followed closely by the oeuvre of André Hazes).
-  If you are an academic: that I am right and you are wrong... .
