This page use the beautiful Jekyll template developed by [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com). Please view that page and the credits. I also heavily rely on [RStudio ](www.rstudio.com)  and [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/). Needless to say that there are numerous R packages which  I am relying on they are listed on the pages or in the .rmds. I am also heavily indebted to [Gert Stulp](https://gertstulp.github.io).  Previously I was funded by [NWO](www.nwo.nl), [Templeton Foundation](www.templeton.org), and [NIAS](www.nias.nl)
