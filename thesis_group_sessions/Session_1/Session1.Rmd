## Researchwise

* Social / Evolutionary psychology / Individual differences

--> Social relationships (Attraction / Jealousy / Friendships / Loneliness)

--> Individual differences (Personality / Height)

--> Methodology (Measurement / Sampling / Simulation)

---
## Other things that interest me.

* Board games (e.g., Wingspan)

* Nintendo switch: mostly turn based: Civilisation 6

* MMA - even published some papers on this.

* Reading: fiction (currently: **Candy house** by Jennifer Egan) and non-fiction (currently: **You don't have to be mad to work here...** by Benji Waterhouse, just finished: **'Bullsh*t jobs'** by David Graeber)

* Nice (Belgian) beer

---
## How I support you.

* You will get the most out of me, if your topic and method aligns with my expertise. Broadly relating to social psychology / social relationships / individual differences.

--

* Reading + feedback on ethics applications (in some cases more support - if method already used)

--

* Advice on literature search (+ literature if in my area), design, analysis, and writing.

--

* In person feedback but supervisors do not read sections or drafts.

--

* **All this support will be offered in these group sessions (supplemented via MS teams). There will be no additional support via email/chat/personal meetings.**

---
## MS Teams

I have set up a group Teams site

Can everyone access it?

--

Each person has their own private channel

Use this to safely store your work

Especially if you want to look at something in the group session, we can both get to it!

```

---
## Analysis support

* Very aware people are nervous about analysis

* Challenging but I am an expert ;).

--> recommendation:

* Pick a simple design with large sample size.

* Group project - learn from one another (own data but similar problems.)

* Up for a challenge --> higher marks

--

In semester 2

You will run your own analysis, and we will discuss.

Together you can help each other

---
## Groups...

You can choose to work on a project with other people in the group
--> You DO NOT have to do this. More on next slide…

--

Whether you work with others or alone, all supervision happens in these sessions

--

Everyone gets regular meetings (if it was individual, meetings would be less frequent)

--

This means that everyone gets more of my time than they would

--

You get peer support from others in the room

--

You can rely on each other outside of the session

```

---
## Group projects.

As stated: you can do a 'solo' project. No pressure. But advantages to working together.

* Few people do research in isolation in the real world. You will also work in teams in work context.

--

* You still have to write your own paper and focus on slightly different aspects of the project. (For example, someone will focus one predictor)

--

* You get to share the work of preparing study materials/recruiting participants/data analysis. Typically better work as less prone to error --> also larger samples - more powerful. 

--

* Your ‘peer support’ is going to be even more specific, others in this room will know way more about the project if they’re involved

--

* I will build accountability into the process (e.g., we'll track how many respondents each person has helped to recruit).

--

* Group members will have a chance to comment on the commitment and work ethic of other group members. Ratings and my own observations are taken into account when marking the final dissertation.

--

* If things go sour - I have a back up plan for certain scenarios.

---
## Constraints on 'solo' projects.

Not anything goes! I am the expert and based on >80 to completion - I know the red flags.

* Projects with ethical implications (e.g., studying drug abuse, trauma, violence, etc). Even if you believe them to be minor, you need to think of the worst case scenario!

--

* Special populations (e.g., incels, children, mental health diagnoses, minorities but also populations like parents, teachers, carers, etc. due to access constraints). Exceptions do exist... .

--

* Most effects in psychology are weak at best - so you'll need a large sample (easily >100) to be able to document even a basic relationship reliably. If concerned about sample size, best to join with others or choose a different approach.

--

* Unfeasible questions (e.g., longitudinal nature) or poor designs (e.g., unable to rule out confounding) or sampling issues (e.g., question is about politics but you only ask students). If you really insist - they will nearly always lead to poor marks... . 

---
## Constraints on 'solo' projects.

* Things we already know pretty well or where a lot better designed studies have been done (e.g., Violence and video games) --> better to do a well thought out replication project or quantitative review on measurement. 

--> If there is already a randomised control study with 1,000s of people, then your small study might be not very informative.

--> This is a thesis not a PhD. Rather a robust replication than a poorly designed underpowered study.

## Timeline

This is a rough timeline… might change week on week depending upon where we’re at!

* Week 1: Get to know you, group discussion on project ideas, advice on literature search

* Week 2: Research Rationale, how to write one and feedback on the work done so far

* Week 3: Study design, planning and implementing study design for your project

* Week 4: Ethics part 1, How to prepare an ethics application?

* Week 5: Ethics part 2, Feedback and revisions on ethics application drafts

---
## Timeline: continued

* Week 6: Implementing study and reflecting on reviewer comments, advice for putting your study online/running it in lab/observational studies/etc.

* Week 7: Participant recruitment / data collection

* Week 8: Writing your methods section

* Week 9: Writing your introduction

* Week 10: Feedback on your written work so far and wrapping up before winter break

## Over to you! Icebreakers.


Everyone hates them – but we’re actually going to spend a lot of time together

In pairs/threes answer the below and one person needs to then introduce the group to me at the end (it will help me remember who you all are)

- Name
- Where you’re from 
- Favourite food
- Favourite sport (to play/to watch) / Favourite show

```{r, out.width= "250px", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}

## Project ideas

* Individual differences in jealousy. --> A replication of a previous study on either height or birth order/attachment/narcissism.

* 'Social anhedonia' and friendships. --> other individual differences and social networks.

* Representation in journals. (Body Image / Autism)

* Measurement via scales.

* Observing use of e-scooters and wearing helmets. E.g. : Are men less likely to wear one than women?

* ['Guardian blind dates' database](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/blind-date)

--> other ideas: [https://tvpollet.github.io/thesis_topics/](https://tvpollet.github.io/thesis_topics/)

---
## Some ideas based on already shared with me

* **Erin**: Perhaps a replication of Seidman - [The Big 5 and relationship maintenance on Facebook](https://doi.org/10.1177/0265407518772089)

* **Molly**: Perhaps a replication of [this study on Jealousy, attachment style above](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886997001360) - or the project below? - A review and meta-analysis of the ['PAQ-R'](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1015344909518)

* **Faye**: Perhaps a replication of ['Private flirts, public friends: Understanding romantic jealousy responses to an ambiguous social network site message as a function of message access exclusivity'](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.02.050)

---
## Matching?

I need your name and three keywords on a piece of paper. (In order of preference) (e.g. John Doe, 1. Psychology of Religion 2. E-Sports 3. Organisational psychology)

Or pick one from the previous slide (Jealousy / Social Networks / Representation in Journals / Measurement / e-scooters / Blind dates)

I'll try and match you up - and then will chat to each group... .
