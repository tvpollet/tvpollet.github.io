On a lighter note: by visiting this site you concur that:    
- Belgian beer and chocolate are the best in the world
- That Cobra is superior to G.I. Joe
- Sega is better than Nintendo
- That Antwerp is the by far nicer than Liverpool, Newcastle, Bruges, Louvain, Brussels (oh yes, Jolein), Ghent and Germany.
-  Mia by Gorki is the best song in Dutch ever. (Yet, followed closely by the oeuvre of André Hazes).
