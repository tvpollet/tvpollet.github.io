## Exercise 9 instructions.

Use the following code below to generate a correlation matrix to use (you'll need to load lavaan).

The data comes from this [paper](http://core.ecu.edu/psyc/wuenschk/Articles/JSB&P2000.pdf). A study testing the Theory of Planned Behaviour when applying to graduate school for 131 students.

```{r}
require(lavaan)
data<-lav_matrix_lower2full(c(1,.47,1,.66,.50,1,.77,.41,.46,1,.52,.38,.50,.50,1))
rownames(data)<-colnames(data)<-c("att",'sn','pbc','int','beh') # a matrix.
```

Reconstruct the model from the article. (Note that there are no (!) latent variables)

Discuss the fit. Make a sem plot.

What happens when you remove the indirect path?

## Basic model from the article.

This exercise is taken from [Huang 2016](http://web.missouri.edu/~huangf/data/mvnotes/Using_R_for_path_analysis.html).

Have a look at the article this is the basic model they propose. The equations are corresponding to Figure 1, they are all **manifest** variables, even though denoted with ellipses rather than rectangles in the original paper. 

```{r}
model<-'
int~att+sn+pbc
beh~int+pbc
'
```

Note: We have a correlation matrix, but the command used refers to covariance matrix.

```{r}
path_model1<-sem(model,sample.cov=data,sample.nobs=131)
```

We can also directly request an $R^2$ measure for this model.

```{r}
summary(path_model1,standardized=T,fit=T,rsquare=T)
```

Let's make a plot... . Our plot looks different but the values pretty much map onto to those of the original article.

```{r}
require(semPlot)
require(qgraph)
semPaths(path_model1,style = "lisrel",what="std",  curvePivot = TRUE)
```

We could calculate the direct, indirect and total paths from this graph. But we could not formally test the mediation.

```{r}
direct_model<-'beh~int+pbc+att+sn'
```

This model actually explains more variance and is a better fit based on AIC and on BIC. Depending on your view, a model with just main effects would thus be parsimonious to one with the indirect pathway.

```{r}
direct_model1<-sem(direct_model,sample.cov=data,sample.nobs=131)
summary(direct_model1,standardized=T,fit=T,rsquare=T)
```

```{r}
anova(path_model1,direct_model1)
```


## Mediation tests.


```{r}
model2<-'
int~att+sn+a*pbc 
beh~b*int+c*pbc

indirect := a*b # we care about this one most.
direct := c
total := c + a*b'
```

Unfortunately we cannot do the bootstrapping without the raw data. The indirect effect is not significant but we are basing this on the correlations... . As you might recall the product-moment approach is not very powerful and our sample is comparatively small.

```{r}
path_model2<-sem(model2, sample.cov=data, sample.nobs=131)
summary(path_model2,standardized=T,fit=T,rsquare=T)
```

## Simulate the original data.

We cannot use the more powerful bootstrapping approach based on the correlation matrix.

We can use the 'gendata' package to simulate a raw dataset which would give the correlations below.

```{r}
library(gendata)
raw<-genmvnorm(data,k=5,n=131,seed=666)
cor(raw)
```

Add the labels.

```{r}
colnames(raw)<-c("att",'sn','pbc','int','beh')
```

Bootstrap. This will take a lot of time.

Contrary, to [Huang](https://web.archive.org/web/20200716131821/http://web.missouri.edu/~huangf/data/mvnotes/Using_R_for_path_analysis.html), we find no evidence for a significant mediation effect.

```{r}
results_raw<-sem(model2,data=raw,se="bootstrap",bootstrap=1000) 
summary(results_raw,standardized=T,fit=T,rsquare=T)
```
