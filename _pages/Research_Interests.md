# Research Interests

I have an atypical profile, perhaps. Due to my methodological interests and background, a large part of my work consists of collaborating with others. Therefore it is hard to summarise what I research.

This wordcloud gives you an idea. It was generated with an amazing [shiny app](https://shiny.rcg.sfu.ca/u/rdmorin/scholar_googler/).

And this is where I tend to publish, ... .

But you might prefer a verbal description.

So when pursuing my own line of research - what do _I_ do:

"My research focuses on understanding the wealth of **social relationships** people have (e.g., romantic relationships, friendships, family relationships) and understanding the role of **individual differences** (e.g., personality, height, hormones,â€¦) for these social relationships from an **interdisciplinary framework**. To this end, I conduct survey, observational, and experimental studies, next to analysing secondary datasets. Furthermore, I am interested in (improving) **methodology and statistics** and frequently collaborate with others on diverse topics."

But as always, this would not have been possible without the [support of others](https://tvpollet.github.io/aboutme).
