This page has some resources for those who already want to get going with PY0794: Quantitative methods.

## Test your knowledge on undergraduate statistics.

* A [quiz](https://nupsych.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9Ymy1PioUMKwnMp){:target="_blank"} to test your knowledge.

* A [shorter quiz](https://nupsych.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3kfiVCMbtipsnTn){:target="_blank"} on significance and your attitudes.

Make sure you read the first page. The surveys are approved by the local ethics committee.

I will still review some basic concepts of statistics and tests  but I am counting that you come with the knowledge from your undergraduate degree.

## Installing RStudio and R

* Rstudio is available on the PCs where I will teach you but you will benefit if you have it on your own machine!  So, I would encourage you to install this **before** the first class.

* Install R and RStudio. Both are freely available software tools. Find R for your operating system (Windows, Mac (OSX),Linux): [here](https://cran.r-project.org/){:target="_blank"}. More detailed [how to guide](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html){:target="_blank"} and/or step 1 and 2 from [here](https://swirlstats.com/students.html){:target="_blank"}. This contains youtube videos. Or check the [not-so-scary-guide to R](https://the-not-so-scary-guide-to-r.com/guides.html){:target="_blank"}.

* A [screencast](https://youtu.be/rlhUid3REFE){:target="_blank"} with a first look at the working environment in RStudio.

## Course Manual

The course manual can be found [here](/outline_statistics_mres.course-11-9web){:target="_blank"}

## Markdown tutorial.

RMarkdown combines R and Markdown. Markdown is a very basic language which is commonly used in programming, you can use it for websites but also for your code on Github.

Have a go with markdown at [www.markdowntutorial.com](http://www.markdowntutorial.com){:target="_blank"}

Here is a [video of me completing a markdown tutorial](https://youtu.be/xuk8yGJJO40){:target="_blank"}. Check out the links in the video comments as well.
