Perhaps inspired by COVID-19 - I decided to list some resources for (student) projects relying on secondary data analysis. 

Hopefully, these are of use, please [contact me](mailto:thomas.pollet) if there are sources which I can add. This is very much work in progress, so do bear with me while this is further developed. There are also even more resources at the end of the page from other webpages which have also pooled these sorts of data.

# Secondary data sources.

Note that for some of these datasets, there will be restrictions in terms of access. If you are a student, you might need a letter from supervisor or analysis plan, before being able to access some of these data. Make sure that you read the terms of use and cite the data source. Many of these will also have technical manuals and codebooks, do familiarise yourself with those! It is important to consider how you will be handling weighing of samples, missing data, non-response and comparability across datasets.

These are in a semi-random order, with no real preference, let alone logic.
