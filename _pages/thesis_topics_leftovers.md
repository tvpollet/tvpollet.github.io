### Visualisations in standard psychology text books.

Bar charts can hide a lot of information. Yet, they are often the default (and while I am hopefully improving, they are also common in my papers). In this project, you will explore and examine the type of figures used in psychology text books. We will focus on a subdiscipline such as evolutionary psychology or consumer psychology, for example.

### Statistical power and moderation effects in social psychology.

You will have heard of the 2 x 2 design. But: were you aware that you likely need around 4 times (if not more) the sample size to establish an interaction effect as opposed to a main effect (Gelman et al., 2020). In this project, you will examine what the typical sample sizes are which are used for 2 x 2 designs and whether interactions are adequately 'powered' in social psychology.

### Evolutionary psychology textbooks and use of anthropological examples.

Evolutionary psychology studies the human mind from an evolutionary perspective via a variety of methods. Often, anthropological data are also invoked as evidence. However, there tends to be only a handful field sites where anthropologists, or at least those with an interest in evolution and human behaviour, have ventured. In this project, you will index which societies have been used as examples in these text books.

### Evolutionary psychology textbooks and scientific racism.

The [Pioneer fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Fund){:target="_blank"} is a controversial organisation which has funded research into eugenics. In this project, you will examine the degree to which researchers funded by the Pioneer fund are cited in Evolutionary Psychology text books.

### 'National Intelligence': How is it used as a concept?

Intelligence is thought to be an individual level construct. Yet, some researchers have argued that we can calculate an estimate of intelligence for a country ?!. Unsurprisingly, this is very controversial. In this project, you will examine for which types of research 'national intelligence' has been used and what its statistical relationship is with other constructs (e.g., GDP per capita).

### Body Mass Index (BMI): A continuous measure that often gets 'binned'.

Some metrics are continuous but we end up turning them into categories. This is typically [a bad idea](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16217841/){:target="_blank"}. With the Body Mass Index (BMI), rather than analysing a continuous variable, researchers might rely on categories such as overweight, underweight, healthy and obese. This comes at an information cost. In this project, you will systematically review papers from the journal 'Body Image' and assess how often researchers apply binning to BMI when testing hypotheses.

## Guardian 'blind dates' database.
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

The Guardian news paper has a returning column in its weekend edition whereby [people go on a date](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/blind-date){:target="_blank"}. We are compiling a database on these dates.

In this project you will contribute to the database, and then you can use the database for your project. It allows you to answer questions on for example, whether men or women are more 'choosy'. Why do some people get high ratings and others low ratings? Are homosexual dates more or less likely to find a match than heterosexual dates?

## Celebrities
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

In this project, you would examine age gaps in relationships in Hollywood celebrities in their marriages or examine late life fatherhood of celebrities. We want to examine to which degree they are similar or different from the general population. For example, do male celebrities father children later in life than the typical American man?


## 'There are no funny women in standup comedy' - Random guy.
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

Together with [Clare Cook](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/c/clare-cook/){:target="_blank"}, I am conducting research on gendered perceptions of stand-up comedians. In this project, we will explore if female standup comedians are perceived as less funny than male standup comedians. We are also interested in finding out other stereotypes (e.g., are attractive women in comedy seen as less funny).

Another option is to examine who people list as being funny comedians and whether those sets differ between men and women.

## Individual differences in "Buy now, pay later"
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

There is an increase in services which allow you to 'buy now and pay later' (e.g., Klarna). In this project, you will examine the individual differences in who uses these types of products. For example, does personality and/or time orientation predict who uses these services.
