I am Prof. Dr. Thomas Pollet. You can find out more about me on this site and on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/tvpollet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @tvpollet</a><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### My work.

My research focuses on understanding the wealth of **social relationships** people have (e.g., romantic relationships, friendships, family relationships) and understanding the role of **individual differences** (e.g., personality, height, hormones,…) for these social relationships from an **interdisciplinary framework**. To this end, I conduct survey, observational, and experimental studies, next to analysing secondary datasets. Furthermore, I am interested in (improving) **methodology and statistics** and frequently collaborate with others on diverse topics (see below).

### Short (academic) bio.

Dr. Thomas Pollet obtained his Ph.D. at [Newcastle University (UK)](www.ncl.ac.uk). He has since worked as Assistant professor at the [University of Groningen](http://www.rug.nl/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIx7vMlrfU1gIV6rztCh1lIwEEEAAYASAAEgJ2KfD_BwE) (the Netherlands) in the department of Evolutionary Social Psychology where he taught several courses on evolution and human behavior. He was also employed as Assistant Professor at the [VU University Amsterdam](https://www.vu.nl/en) (Social and Organizational Psychology) where he carried out teaching and research using an evolutionary framework. From November 2016 to July 2017 he worked for [Universiteit Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en). In July 2017, he took up a post as Associate Professor (Reader) with [Northumbria University](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk), where he was promoted to Professor in September 2020.

### Personal

Occasionally, I'll include my middle initial V. to differentiate from other Thomas Pollet's (e.g., [this one](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomaspollet/?ppe=1))

I rock a great beard. What else do you **really** need to know? I play squash (albeit poorly), enjoy hiking holidays, like nature documentaries. I live and work in Newcastle (UK).

Apart from beard related stuff, I like gibbons and cats as you can see on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/tvpollet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @tvpollet</a><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
